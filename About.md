# LinuxLiveUsbCreator
Tool To Create Linux Live Portables, With Persistent Data Support
This software has been created by Thibaut Lauzière (a.k.a Slÿm) and is coded using the excellent AutoIT ( https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/ ) scripting language.

Formerly known as uSbuntu Live Creator, the project started in November 2008, just for fun at first. Then I realize that many people were interested in such a tool and so I started to be more serious about it's development.

LinuxLive USB Creator is released under GPL v3 License Terms which means you can do almost whatever you want with its source code.

Big thanks to all the TuxFamily's team for their kick-ass free webhosting platform!
